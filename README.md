## 🧠 About the Project

**AI Expense Tracker** is a modern and intelligent platform that allows users to track their expenses efficiently using an intuitive UI and smart features like AI-based categorization. Designed for individuals and professionals, this app helps users make informed financial decisions through real-time insights, seamless account management, and personalized dashboards.

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Managing finances manually can be tedious. We wanted to build a smart, AI-powered app that automates categorization, simplifies tracking, and provides a beautiful user experience — helping people focus on *how* they spend, not *how* to track it.
